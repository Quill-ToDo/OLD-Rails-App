# Spike's To-Do - Creating a to-do app that's intuitive and powerful
## Getting Started

```bash
   bundle config without production
   bundle install
```

## Commits, Branches, and Pull Requests
- Before starting anything, make sure you:
    - ```bash
      git checkout main
      git pull
      git checkout -b "branch-name"
      ```
    - This ensures that you are working on the newest copy of the project.
- Make sure your commit messages are descriptive, and in the present tense (per convention)
    - Example (using active voice)
    ```
      // Bad:
      I created a card component and added the rainbow as well as updated the image size

      // Good:
      Create card component
        - add rainbow bar
        - update image size
    ```
    - Your commit message should look like a list of instructions
